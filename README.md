## RAISELY APPLICATION

A few notes on what was built here.

## Tools

- Create-React-App (I usually go with NextJS or Gatsby, but since there was no routing it seemed like overkill)
- TailwindCSS (Easy to get up and running and since there are so few components it is easy to use just a few classes. If the project were scaled up I would proabably go with something like Styled Components)
- VanillaJS Fetch API (Could have used something like Axios here, but thought I would show a library is not always needed.  Axios would have been a bit cleaner for chaining the API requests though.)
